## Deployment Guidelines

- The backend server is deployed and fully operational without any CORS, 404, or 504 errors.  
- Frontend deployed live with working routing and no errors on page reload on any route.  
- Firebase authorized domains configured to match deployment URL.  
- JWT tokens stored securely on the client side and used for private route protection.  

---

## Development & Commit Practices

- 15+ meaningful commits on the client side with descriptive messages.  
- 8+ meaningful commits on the server side with descriptive messages.  
- Proper code structuring, comments, and clean, readable code.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the client and server repositories separately.  
2. Run `npm install` in both client and server folders.  
3. Set up `.env` files in both projects with Firebase and MongoDB credentials (do **not** commit these files).  
4. Start the backend server (`npm run start` or `npm run dev`).  
5. Start the frontend React app (`npm start`).  
6. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
